# Streamline Your Research Materials with Tropys


You've been there--getting home from an incredible research trip to an archive, maps collection, or gallery only to face down thousands of photos all labelled "IMG50293.png." Join Research Data Management Specialist Danica Evering and Data Analysis and Visualization Librarian Subhanya Sivajothy for an overview of Tropy: a free and open-source solution to explore and manage research photos. In this webinar, you will learn how to use Tropy to zoom into details, tag and organize content with metadata, and begin uncovering patterns across your sources. We will also explore how Tropy connects with Zotero for reference management and Omeka for building digital exhibits, offering a full workflow from research to public presentation.

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn to:
- Use Tropy to organize, annotate, analyze and manage research materials image collections.
- Select appropriate metadata and implement documentation and tagging systems.
- Integrate Tropy with Zotero and Omeka to cite archival sources and enhance the impact of your research and digital exhibitions.

No prior knowledge of the software will be required but please come with a version of the software downloaded for the demo (https://tropy.org/)! We'll be doing some hands-on experimentation with the software to get you familiar with these tools.
