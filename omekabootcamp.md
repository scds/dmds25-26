# Create a Digital Exhibition with Omeka S

Have a creative project you want to showcase online? Join this hands-on bootcamp to kickstart building your own digital exhibition site using Omeka S, a free and open-source web publishing platform designed for creating and managing online archives and exhibits.

In this workshop, we will cover Omeka S fundamentals, including best practices for organizing archival item collections, adding detailed metadata, and setting up a basic website. We will also explore more advanced features like creating interactive elements and using modules to extend your siteâ€™s functionality. Whether you come with a project idea or just want to learn the platform, there will be dedicated time to develop your own site with support available throughout the session.

By the end of this bootcamp, you will:
- Learn how to add and manage items in Omeka S
- Understand key features that make digital exhibitions engaging and effective, and have your exhibit reviewed by the instructor.

This session is great for researchers, students, librarians, archivists, artists, and anyone interested in digital storytelling, online archiving, or building accessible web exhibitions! No prior experience with Omeka or web publishing is required.
