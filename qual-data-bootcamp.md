# Qualitative Data Bootcamp


Calling all qualitative researchers! Get ready to take care of and analyze qualitative research data: interview transcripts, surveys oral histories, focus groups, field notes, artistic expression, photovoice and more. Qualitative methods let us understand lived experiences and motivations, see a research question from different standpoints, and highlight contexts. 

This bootcamp is for those trying to get a qualitative research project off the ground who would like support on different aspects across the research lifecycle. Starting with Data Management Planning, we will discuss data management during collection, qualitative data analysis fundamentals such as conducting the analysis, and end with effective ways of sharing data and communicating results. These tangible actions will work alongside more advanced questions about ethics and uncertainty. 

We’ll practice hands-on with de-identification and open-source tools such as QualCoder for qualitative data analysis and introduce some techniques that can be used. Participants are not expected to have any prior knowledge of these tools when coming into the workshop. There will be both case studies as well as opportunities to work on your project and receive feedback in the moment. 

During this bootcamp session, participants will learn to:
- Describe and contrast different qualitative data methodologies and be able to pick the most appropriate one for your project. 
- Apply some basic qualitative data analysis techniques using QualCoder. 
- Experiment with data management plans, de-identification, recording, and transcription. 
- Locate resources for data deposit and sharing of qualitative data and compare and contrast benefits and challenges.

This session is great for qualitative researchers across all faculties, especially those working in Health Sciences, Social Sciences, and the Humanities. Whether you're new to qualitative methods or looking to deepen your approach, you'll find practical tools and insights to support your work.
