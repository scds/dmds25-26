# Creating Interactive Data Visualizations with Power BI

Want to turn your data into clear, compelling visuals? In this beginner-friendly workshop, you will learn how to use Power BI, a powerful tool for building interactive dashboards and charts. Power BI is freely available to McMaster users, making it a great option for coursework, research, and projects. 

In this session, participants will learn to:
- Clean and prepare data
